# movie-library-app

## Plan progression

- [x] Research and learn Nestjs
  - [x] Create a mini project to learn from
- [x] Research and understand RTK Query

#### The initial thought is to implement all required functions and use technologies recommended by the task and the technologies included in the bonus section.

_By doing so I will be learning new technologies/libraries, such as Nestjs and RTK_
_Considering the benefits of using Nestjs over Expressjs, such as better native support for type safety, built-in features, and better structure for scalability._

### Main functionalities:

- [ ] List a number of movies.
- [ ] Search for a movie by title.
- [ ] Filter movies by different genres.
- [ ] Responsive behaviour. Make sure the app gracefully scales down to a mobile view.

### Technologies

- Reactjs for FE
- NestJs for BE
- RTK Query
- React hook forms
- Styled components

# Frontend (React) Implementation

### RTK Query Setup:

- [ ] Create an API slice using createApi and fetchBaseQuery.

### Components:

- [ ] MovieList.tsx: Displays a list of movies.
- [ ] Search.tsx: Search input using React Hook Form.
- [ ] Filter.tsx: Filter by genre using React Hook Form.
- [ ] MovieCard.tsx: Displays a single movie card.

### State Management:

- [ ] Use RTK Query hooks (e.g., useGetMoviesQuery, useSearchMoviesQuery) to fetch and cache data.
- [ ] Use Redux slices to manage local UI state (e.g., loading indicators, error messages).

### Styling:

- [ ] Use Styled Components or MUI components for styling.
- [ ] Implement responsive design using media queries.

### Routing:

- [ ] React Router for navigation.
