# movie-library-app
## Plan progression
- [x] Research and learn Nestjs
  - [x] Create a mini project to learn from
- [ ] Research and understand RTK Query


#### The initial thought is to implement all required functions and use technologies recommended by the task and the technologies included in the bonus section.
*By doing so I will be learning new technologies/libraries, such as Nestjs and RTK*
*Considering the benefits of using Nestjs over Expressjs, such as better native support for type safety, built-in features, and better structure for scalability.*

### Main functionalities:
- [ ] List a number of movies.
- [ ] Search for a movie by title.
- [ ] Filter movies by different genres.
- [ ] Responsive behaviour. Make sure the app gracefully scales down to a mobile view.

### Technologies 
- Reactjs for FE
- NestJs for BE
- RTK Query
- React hook forms
- Styled components
